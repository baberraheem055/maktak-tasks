# Streamlit Application with PandasAI
## Introduction
PandasAI is a powerful tool designed to enhance data analysis workflows by integrating large language models (LLMs) with the Pandas library. It allows users to interact with data using natural language queries, making complex data manipulations and analyses more accessible. By combining PandasAI with Streamlit, we can create an intuitive web application that facilitates prompt-driven data analysis.

# Why Use PandasAI
PandasAI is beneficial for:

Simplified Data Interaction: Enables users to perform data queries and manipulations using natural language, reducing the need for complex code.
Increased Efficiency: Automates data analysis tasks, making it quicker and easier to obtain insights.
Enhanced Accessibility: Makes data analysis tools available to users without extensive programming knowledge.
How to Use the Application
Start the Application: Run the Streamlit application script to launch a local server.
Upload Data: Use the file uploader to upload a CSV file.
Enter a Query: Type a natural language question or command related to the data into the provided text area.
Generate and View Results: Click the "Generate" button to receive a response based on the input, displayed alongside relevant visual elements.
Dependencies
The application relies on several key libraries and tools, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. Typical dependencies include:

streamlit – For building the interactive web application.
pandas – For data manipulation and analysis.
pandasai – For natural language processing capabilities.
langchain_groq – For integrating with the Groq LLM.
python-dotenv – For managing environment variables.
matplotlib – For plotting, though not directly used in this code.
